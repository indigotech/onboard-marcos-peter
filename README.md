# Marcos Peter's Onboard's Project

### There's my first project inside Taqtile

## Environment and tools

First of all run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:indigotech/onboard-marcos-peter.git
```

After cloning the project you need to ensure that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed.

## Steps to run and debug

Now it's time to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Verify if the [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is installed correctly and run the docker container:

```bash
docker -v
```

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

And finally run the project:

```bash
npm run start
```
